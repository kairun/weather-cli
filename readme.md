# Weather Forecast
This CLI app is indented to parse a user input of a location, and provide overview of the weather for the location

# Caveats
1. Currently only works with city names

# Run
On your favourite CLI, run
```
npm run weather
```

When prompted, enter a city name. If city name is ambiguous, provide country code followed by comma (e.g. `London, UK`)

# Develop
On your favourite CLI, run
```
npm run dev
```

`dev` because this project is written with TDD
